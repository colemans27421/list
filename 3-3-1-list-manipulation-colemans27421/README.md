# List Manipulation

Or...fun with palindromes!

The purpose of this exercise is not only to practice list manipulation, but also to build on what you've learned so far and to continue using code to solve *actual problems*.

Your task is to use what you've learned so far (in all lessons) to determine if a given string is a palindrome -- that is, a word or phrase that is the same backwards as forwards. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome, while "dumptruck" is not.

## Basic and Challenge Options

This assignment has two "modes" to it.

**Basic**: The "basic" test is the minimum required to consider this assignment "passed." If you do only this one, you can get a maximum of 85%, which is a solid B.

**Challenge**: The "challenge" test requires some more thought and puzzling out, but will get you the full 100% if you complete it. In order to get full credit for this part, the tests for the basic list *must still pass*. 

Both parts can be solved using language features we've already covered or introduced, though may require a little additional exploring for the exact things you need. 

Things we haven't covered yet have been provided for you.

## Usual Info

Like before, the tests will fail initially (with this one, you do have the extra challenge that Python itself is currently throwing a Flake error, so you will need to handle that in the course of your coding). Your task is to make the source code changes required to get them working. The source file will provide more information on how to do that via notes and/or pre-existing code, and the tests will also provide you information for what's expected.

Also like before, **do not change the tests!** Your assignment submission will be considered invalid until your tests are reverted to their original state.

## Submitting Your Assignment

You are welcome and encouraged to commit and push your code as often as you like. While that may only be once in these first few lessons, that will likely increase as the assignments get more complex.

**This one will be considered for grading if at least the basic tests pass.** If you want to submit an assignment for grading that does not have all its basic tests passing, then send me a message to let me know that you're submitting the attempt as-is.
